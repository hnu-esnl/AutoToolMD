/*-
 * The generated code includes comments that allow you to trace directly
 * back to the appropriate location in the model.  The basic format
 * is <system>/block_name, where system is the system number (uniquely
 * assigned by Simulink) and block_name is the name of the block.
 *
 * Use the MATLAB hilite_system command to trace the generated code back
 * to the model.  For example,
 *
 * hilite_system('<S3>')    - opens system 3
 * hilite_system('<S3>/Kp') - opens and selects block Kp which resides in S3
 *
 * Here is the system hierarchy for this model
 *
 * '<Root>' : 'ElecDoorHndl_ComCnvRx'
 * '<S1>'   : 'ElecDoorHndl_ComCnvRx/ElecDoorHndl_ComCnvRx_Runnable_10ms_sys'
 * '<S2>'   : 'ElecDoorHndl_ComCnvRx/ElecDoorHndl_ComCnvRx_Runnable_Init'
